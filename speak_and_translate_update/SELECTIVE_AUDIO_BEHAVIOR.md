# 🎵 Selective Word-by-Word Audio Behavior

## Overview

The Ultra-Advanced AI Translation System now supports **selective word-by-word audio** behavior, meaning:

- **ALL selected translation styles** are always provided
- **Word-by-word audio** is only generated for languages where the user specifically enabled it
- Languages without word-by-word enabled get **translation text only**

## User Settings Examples

## Technical Implementation

### Audio Processing Pipeline

1. **Translation Generation**: ALL selected styles are translated
2. **Audio Filtering**: Check `german_word_by_word` and `english_word_by_word` flags
3. **Selective Audio**: Generate word-by-word audio only for enabled languages
4. **UI Synchronization**: Perfect sync only for languages with audio

### Key Functions

- `generate_selective_sync_audio()` - Main selective audio function
- `_filter_word_by_word_by_language()` - Filter data by audio preferences
- `_check_if_word_by_word_audio_needed()` - Check if any audio is needed
- `_create_selective_ui_sync_markers()` - Create sync markers for enabled languages

### Logging Output

```
🎵 SELECTIVE Audio Generation - Language Filtering Active
📋 TRANSLATION & AUDIO BEHAVIOR:
   🇩🇪 German word-by-word audio: True
   🇺🇸 English word-by-word audio: False
🔍 Filtered word-by-word data: 15/30 entries need audio
✅ Selective audio generated for: German (125.3ms)
```

## Performance Benefits

- **Faster Processing**: Only generates audio for needed languages
- **Reduced Memory**: Less audio data when not all languages need audio
- **Selective Caching**: Different cache keys for different audio combinations
- **Perfect Sync**: UI synchronization only where needed

## Console Output Format

```

## Benefits for Language Learning

1. **Focused Learning**: Audio only where the user wants to practice
2. **Multi-Style Support**: Get all translations, choose which to hear
3. **Flexible Practice**: Different audio settings for different languages
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Don't waste processing on unwanted audio
5. **Perfect Synchronization**: When audio is enabled, it's perfectly synced

## API Integration

The system automatically detects the user's preferences from the settings and applies selective audio generation without any additional API changes needed. The existing UI and backend seamlessly support this new behavior.
