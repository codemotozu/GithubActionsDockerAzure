# Gemini API Quota Optimization Guide

## Problem Solved
Your translation service was hitting Gemini API quotas because it was using the experimental `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model and making very large requests (22,438+ characters per translation).

## Changes Made

### 1. Switched to Standard Model
- Changed from `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` to `gemini-1.5-flash`
- Standard model has different quota limits

### 2. Dramatically Reduced Prompt Size
- **Before**: 22,438+ characters per request
- **After**: ~500-800 characters per request (95% reduction!)
- Removed verbose instructions and examples
- Simplified word-by-word instructions

### 3. Added Quota Management Options
If you still hit quota limits, you can temporarily disable word-by-word features:

**In `translation_service.py` line 50:**
```python
self.enable_word_by_word = False  # Set to False to reduce API quota usage
```

This will disable word-by-word translations but keep the main translations working.

## Quota Limits Reference
- **Free Tier**: 50 requests/day for `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
- **gemini-1.5-flash**: Different limits (typically higher)

## Quick Fix if Still Having Issues
1. **Wait 24 hours** for quota reset
2. **Temporarily disable word-by-word**: Set `enable_word_by_word = False`
3. **Consider upgrading** to paid tier for higher quotas

## Performance Benefits
- ✅ **Much faster**: Smaller prompts = faster processing
- ✅ **Uses less quota**: 95% reduction in prompt size
- ✅ **More reliable**: Standard model instead of experimental
- ✅ **Google Translate removed**: No more slow external API calls

Your translations should now be much faster and use significantly less of your API quota!
